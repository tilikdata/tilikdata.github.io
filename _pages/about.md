Tilik Data was founded in late 2024 by Rangga A. Akhli, driven by his passion for analyzing the world around him through the use of public data and sharing insights with the broader community. The name “Tilik Data” comes from the Indonesian word “Tilik,” meaning to observe or examine, which reflects the essence of our work—carefully analyzing data to uncover meaningful stories.

Our logo, shaped like a circle and resembling a 50/50 donut chart, symbolizes Tilik Data’s commitment to presenting balanced data. The teal color is associated with calmness and creativity, while the dark blue represents depth and wisdom. This color choice embodies our data analysis process, which is grounded in the principles of calmness, creativity, depth, and wisdom.

Additionally, the right-angled triangle in the logo signifies our dedication to logic and rationality, highlighting the importance of these principles in our work. The alpha symbol often represents the accuracy and precision of our measurements, as well as our ability to manage uncertainty in the analytical process.

At Tilik Data, we strive to provide data-driven insights that are thoughtful, accurate, and well-balanced, empowering our audience to make informed decisions with confidence.
