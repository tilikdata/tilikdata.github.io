Tilik Data, founded in late 2024 by Rangga A. Akhli, is a data-driven project dedicated to providing insights into critical societal issues. Our goal is to foster understanding and encourage meaningful conversations about the social, economic, and political challenges of our time. Through meticulous data analysis and clear visualizations, we aim to make complex issues more accessible and actionable for our audience.

The name "Tilik Data" is derived from the Indonesian word "Tilik," which means to observe or examine. This reflects our core mission of carefully analyzing public data to uncover valuable stories and insights. We believe that data can empower individuals and communities to make informed decisions and drive positive change.

Our logo embodies the values we hold at Tilik Data. The circular shape, resembling a 50/50 donut chart, symbolizes our commitment to presenting balanced and unbiased data. The color teal, associated with calmness and creativity, represents the thoughtful approach we take in our work. Dark blue, symbolizing depth and wisdom, reflects our dedication to producing insights that are not only accurate but also meaningful.

The right-angled triangle in the logo signifies our emphasis on logic and rationality, ensuring that every analysis is grounded in sound reasoning. The alpha symbol, often associated with precision and measurement, underscores our commitment to accuracy and our ability to manage uncertainty in the data we analyze.

At Tilik Data, we are dedicated to providing insights that are clear, thoughtful, and balanced, empowering our audience to engage meaningfully with important societal issues.
